# Moto App - MERN

## Project Description

This is an E-Commerce platform which is completely based on MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node).

## Features

So, the features we would be having in the application that we would be building are:-

1.  Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2.  Option to add, edit, view and delete all the items in our store.
3.  Option to add items or remove items from the cart.
4.  Display the total bill of the cart and update it as soon as the cart is updated by the user.
5.  Using Local Storage to store the JWT so that we only allow logged-in users to buy items.
6.  Option to pay and checkout thus creating order and emptying the cart.
7.  Option to add or update review to the products you've brought.
8.  Admin Panel where admin can manage products, users, orders etc.
9.  Admin can also see the analytical dashboard.
